        <h6 style="text-align: center; padding-left: 50px; padding-right: 50px;">Daturas are feral desert horses closely related to the American Mustang. Their name comes from the Datura flower, a highly poisonous plant, and reflects their unusual immunity to toxins. It is best to admire them from afar, as Daturas are famous for their unfriendly attitude.</h6>
